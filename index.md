## Introduction ##

The National Pathology FHIR Messaging Specfication aims to address the key objective of the National Pathology and Diagnostic service, in being able to share pathology results in primary and secondary care settings across the NHS landscape. The main scope of the API is to provide a FHIR STU3 payload, which contains pathology (haematology and clinical biochemistry) results transported over the [MESH](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/message-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-mesh) network between a Laboratory Information Management System and the requesting system.
