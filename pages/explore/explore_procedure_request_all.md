## Test Request Summary Overview for a Haemotology or Chemical Biology Test ##

Information from the original request that is returned with the test report.
This has two purposes. 
- 1.) To assist in linking the report to the original request; 
- 2.) Give context to the test report where the receiving HCP is different to the requesting HCP and does not have access to the original request.

## Mapping for Procedure Request ##

The test request summary is used to capture the details about the test that has been requested by a healthcare organisation 

How to populate the Procedure Request instance to conform to the profiles below:

|**Level 1**|[ProcedureRequest Resource](http://hl7.org/fhir/stu3/procedurerequest.html)|**Level 2**|[CareConnect-ProcedureRequest-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-ProcedureRequest-1/_history/1.1)|**Level 3**|None|
