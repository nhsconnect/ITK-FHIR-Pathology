## Test Group Overview ##

Contains data on a group of test results. In this case a group is considered any group of tests that have been defined as a group by the performing organisation. For example - Full Blood Count. The group may be a standard group defined nationally, a locally defined group or a non standard group of tests. It is populated by the performing organisation.
In the way we have defined test group it is a synonym for test battery, panel or profile (in a testing sense not FHIR).


## Mapping for Observation ##

How to populate the Observation instance to conform to the profiles below:

|**Level 1**|[Observation Resource](http://hl7.org/fhir/stu3/observation.html)|**Level 2**|[CareConnect-Observation-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Observation-1)|**Level 3**|None|
