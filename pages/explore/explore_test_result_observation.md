## Overview ##

Contains data on clinical test performed on patient where there are multiple values. This information may or may not be linked to a test report or a test group. It is populated by the performing organisation. The majority of test results will contain a single value however there are tests with multiple values (for example blood pressure). As a general rule - where there are multiple values that can potentially have an independent clinical interpretation they are considered as multiple test results each with their own value (For example: Full Blood Count) - where there are multiple values which can only be interpreted together they are considered as a single test result with multiple values (For example: Glucose Absorption Test) 

## Mapping for Observation ##

How to populate the Observation instance to conform to the profiles below:

|**Level 1**|[Observation Resource](http://hl7.org/fhir/stu3/observation.html)|**Level 2**|[CareConnect-Observation-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Observation-1/_history/1.1)|**Level 3**|None|
